# neuralnetmusic
Felix's project for composing music using neural nets.

This is not in a state fit for public use right now, so play with at your own risk.  The parser.py module turns musicxml files into training data.  The DBN.py module trains a DBN (deep belief network), and generates new music.  You need Theano to run.
